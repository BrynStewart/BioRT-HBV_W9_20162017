Base case input and output files for HBV-light and BioRT models used in Stewart et al., (in prep.).

HBV_Files directory includes "Data" and "Results" directories for simulation of hydrology in HBV-light. BioRT_Files directory includes "input" and "output" directories for simulation of biogeochemical reactions and transport processes in BioRT.

Hydrometeorology, aqueous chemistry, and snow data from Sleepers River are available in the following references:
